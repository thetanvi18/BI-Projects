# HR Analytics Dashboard: Employee Attrition Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is an interactive HR Analytics dashboard built in Tableau that analyzes employee attrition (turnover). The main goal is to provide a clear, at-a-glance understanding of key HR metrics and identify the primary factors contributing to employees leaving the company.

The dashboard empowers stakeholders (like HR managers and executives) to pinpoint problem areas, such as which departments have the highest attrition or which job roles have the lowest satisfaction, enabling them to make data-driven decisions.

## Key Features & Analysis

This dashboard consolidates multiple analyses into one interactive view:

* Executive KPIs: A top-level summary of the most critical metrics:
    * Total Employee Count
    * Total Attrition Count
    * Overall Attrition Rate
    * Active Employee Count
    * Average Employee Age

* Interactive Controls:
    * Filter by Education: Allows users to drill down into the data based on employees' educational backgrounds.
    * Adjustable Age Bins: A parameter-driven slider lets the user change the grouping for the "No. of Employees by Age Group" histogram (e.g., group by 3 years, 5 years, etc.).

* Key Analytical Views:
    * Departmentwise Attrition (Pie Chart):** Breaks down the total number and percentage of leavers by department (R&D, Sales, HR).
    * Job Satisfaction Rating (Highlight Table):** A heatmap that cross-references 'Job Role' with 'Job Satisfaction' scores (1-4), quickly identifying roles with low satisfaction.
    * Attrition by Education Field (Bar Chart):** Shows the total number of attritions for each field of study.
    * Attrition by Age & Gender (Donut Charts):** A series of donut charts that visualize the gender split of attrition within specific age bands (Under 25, 25-34, etc.).
    * Employee Age Distribution (Histogram):** Shows the overall age distribution of the workforce.

## Technical Implementation

* Tool: Tableau Desktop 2025
* Data Source: A single Excel file (`HR Data.xlsx`) containing a flat table of employee records.
* Calculated Fields:
    * `Attrition Count`: Created a binary field (`IF [Attrition]='Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END`) to enable numerical aggregation of attrition.
    * `Attrition Rate`: `SUM([Attrition Count]) / SUM([Employee Count])`.
    * `Active Employees`: `SUM([Employee Count]) - SUM([Attrition Count])`.
* Parameters:
    * `Bin Size`: A user-controlled parameter that dynamically changes the bin size for the Age histogram.
* Dashboard Design:
    * Used a dark background image and a clean, tiled layout for a professional feel
    * Charts are organized logically, with high-level KPIs at the top and detailed breakdowns below.
